## Intro

CSS3-BOX implements the CSS3 flexbox layout draft as a set of LESS mixins.

Use css3-box to build web applications that don't take "a page", but a screen as the primary layout reference.

Also included is a set of layer mixins to build a layered app.


## Quick start

Install with [Bower](http://bower.io): `bower install css3-box`


## Demo

Fork/download the demo to see CSS3-BOX in action or use it as a scaffold for your next rich web application.

Do notice the slide-out navigation and adapted bootstrap modal dialog--for a truly responsive user experience!

Any comments/suggestions/tips are of course more than welcome ;-)
